# Qwen3-Coder Case Study

This folder contains the results of a comparative analysis between different AI models generating marketing documents for the Codi CLI tool.

## Files Included

1. `PROCESS-MARKETING-DOC.md` - Detailed documentation of how the marketing document was generated using reader agents
2. `codi-marketing-document.md` - The marketing document generated by Qwen3-Coder:480B-Cloud
3. `ANALYSIS-MARKETING-DOCS.md` - Comparative analysis of marketing documents generated by different AI models

## Overview

This case study demonstrates:
- How Codi's multi-agent orchestration capabilities can be used for research tasks
- The differences in output between Qwen3-Coder:480B-Cloud and GLM-4.7:Cloud
- Insights into AI model characteristics for content generation tasks

The documents were generated by prompting Codi to "delegate two readers to read the repository and come up with a marketing document" using Qwen3-Coder:480B-Cloud as the primary model.
