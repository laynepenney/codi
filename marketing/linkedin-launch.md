I'm excited to share Codi — an open-source AI coding assistant that lives in your terminal.

After months of building, I wanted an AI tool that:
✅ Works with ANY provider (Claude, GPT, Ollama, local models)
✅ Actually reads and writes my code (not just chat)
✅ Shows me diffs before changes (safety first)
✅ Runs locally and free with Ollama

So I built it.

🔧 What Codi can do:
• Read/write files, search code, run commands
• Generate commits, PRs, tests, docs
• Remember context across sessions
• Auto-detect your project type

🔒 Safety features:
• Diff preview before every file change
• Approval prompts for dangerous operations
• Full undo history

The best part? Run it completely free with Ollama:
ollama pull llama3.2
codi --provider ollama

Open source under Apache 2.0.

## Image Strategy

### Option 1: Demo GIF (Recommended for engagement)
Use `assets/demo.gif` - shows Codi in action with /help, /status, AI chat, and ?git search.

### Option 2: Feature Cards
Create a carousel of 3-4 images:
1. Multi-provider support (logos: Claude, GPT, Ollama)
2. Safety features (diff preview screenshot)
3. Built-in commands (/commit, /test, /refactor)
4. Local & free with Ollama

### Option 3: Social Preview Banner
Use `assets/social-preview.png` for link preview when sharing GitHub URL.
