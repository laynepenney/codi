2. `marketing-document.md` - The marketing document generated by Qwen3-Coder
3. `ANALYSIS-MARKETING-DOCS.md` - Analysis comparing Qwen3-Coder output with other models

## Overview

This case study demonstrates:
- How Codi's reader agent system can be used for content generation tasks
- The approach Qwen3-Coder takes to marketing content creation

The documents were generated by prompting Codi to "delegate two readers to read the repository and come up with a marketing document" using Qwen3-Coder:480B-Cloud as the primary model.
