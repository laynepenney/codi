I've been using Claude Code and OpenAI Codex for months, and they've completely changed how I write software.

But I wanted to understand how these tools actually work. So I built my own.

Meet Codi — an open-source AI coding assistant inspired by Claude Code and Codex.

Building it taught me:
• How agentic AI loops work (tool calls, context management, streaming)
• The importance of safety features (diff previews, approval prompts)
• Why multi-provider support matters (not everyone wants to pay for API calls)

What makes Codi different:
🔌 Works with ANY provider — Claude, GPT, Ollama, or local models
🔒 Safety first — see diffs before changes, approve dangerous operations
💰 Run it FREE with Ollama (no API key needed)
🛠️ Full toolkit — read/write files, search code, run tests, generate commits

The best part? You can run it completely locally:
ollama pull llama3.2
codi --provider ollama

Open source under Apache 2.0. Built with Claude's help, of course.

GitHub: https://github.com/laynepenney/codi

If you're curious about AI tooling or want to learn by building, I'd love to hear what you're working on.

## Image Strategy

### Option 1: Demo GIF (Recommended for engagement)
Use `assets/demo.gif` - shows Codi in action with /help, /status, AI chat, and ?git search.

### Option 2: Feature Cards
Create a carousel of 3-4 images:
1. Multi-provider support (logos: Claude, GPT, Ollama)
2. Safety features (diff preview screenshot)
3. Built-in commands (/commit, /test, /refactor)
4. Local & free with Ollama

### Option 3: Social Preview Banner
Use `assets/social-preview.png` for link preview when sharing GitHub URL.
