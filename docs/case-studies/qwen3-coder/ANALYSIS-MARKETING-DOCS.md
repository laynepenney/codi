2. **E1** - Created with Qwen3-Coder:480B-Cloud (recently generated)

## Key Differences in Structure and Content

### 1. Document Organization

**GLM-4.7 (MARKETING.md)** follows a highly structured enterprise-style format:
- Tabular feature comparisons
- Detailed technical specifications

- Specific code examples for installation and usage
- Detailed specifications for context windows and model capabilities
- Extensive technical innovation section covering 6 key architectural highlights
- Granular details about multi-agent orchestration with sample commands
- Model maps with YAML configuration examples

The Qwen3-Coder document provides broader conceptual explanations:
